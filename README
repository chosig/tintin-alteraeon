NOTES:
If you turn off line invertion, tintin++ seems to work better - fewer blank lines etc. To do so, in the game type invert and you should get the message that line invertion mode has been disabled.
Quest code works great now. The code now uses the newly added kxwt_event quest feature. In short, this means quests are posted right away, no odd hacks needed.
Finally switched over to ogg123for sounds, so now the requirement of vorbis-tools is more necessary. If for some reason you can not use vorbis tools though just change the soundCommand variable in aa.tin.
To counter the bug in gnome-terminal with the Orca screen reader, a space has been added to the beginning of each line.
If you don't need this and want to get rid of it, delete the line:
#SUBSTITUTE       {%*}  { %0}  {1}
Work has started on background music/sound effects. If you happen to notice a lot of blank lines and the screen is hard to read type:
set ctrigger off
There are no sound effects for backgrounds yet. If you want to make some read help wxkt_terrain in the game. the terrain files should be terrain-number.ogg where number is the number corrisponding to the terrain type. For example, terain-2.ogg would be for towns. Until work is finished on terrain sounds music will be off by default.

Connecting:
To connect, edit name.tin. Change the text in the second set of braces in each of the 2 variables to match your character's name and password.
To start tintin++ with the sound and trigger pack loaded type:
tt++ aa.tin

Requirements:
ogg123 part of vorbis-tools
shuf usually included in most distros

Skills and Spells:
Some skills and spells can automatically be used while you are playing. To make sure everything is set up, type load. You should only need to do this once, because the data will now be saved in the file game_data.tin. To make sure the data is up to date, when you practice a new skill or spell, type skill or spell followed by the name of the skill or spell you just practiced. for example, if you have just practiced kick for the first time, type:
skill kick
to make sure it is added to the variables in game_data.tin.
An example of autousage is clay man for necromancers. To turn on automatic recast when your clay man dies type autoclay and to turn it back off type noautoclay.

Twitter:
You can have achievements like backstabs, levels, and achievements posted to Twitter. If you have the CLI Twitter client TTYtter installed and configured correctly, type twitter and events will be posted. To turn it off type notwitter.

Commands:
In most cases, for longer words, you can type part of the command. The exception to this is auto stuff like autoclay, autobone, autofiend, autostore, etc - You will have to experiment because the  commands start where mud commands end. For example, if you type fire, you will connect to the fire channel. If, however, you type fireb all the way through fireball, you will cast the spell fireball if you have it.
alt+1 through alt+0 play last 1 through tenth message.
alt+w makes a wood woad if you have the spell and woad material is in your container.
alt+b makes a bone guardian if the requirements are met.
alt+u northwest
alt+i north

alt+j west
alt+k enter portal
alt+l east

autoclay cast clay man automatically if your current clay man dies
autobonearmor recast bone armor when it drops. Will automatically soulbind the armor if you have the skill and a blue soulstone. use noautobonearmor to turn it off.
autowoad automatically try to create a new wood woad if the current woad dies.
(NOTES: turn off the autocast with noautoclay or noautowoad. These should not be used together and turning on one should disable the other.
the variable woadMaterial should be set to the material you want to use to create the woad. The material for creating the woad should be located in your container. The container variable needs to be set for this to work as well. Anytime you put something somewhere the destination is set as your container. So, put gondola sack will set your container as sack)
autobone tries to make a bone guardian automatically. You need container set and some deanimated bones in your container for this to work. Of course the container variable has to be set.
autometal Makes a metal construct, same requirements aas bone guardian and wood woad except the material has to be metal.
autofiend Automatically make a new shadow fiend if the current one leaves or dies. You need soulstones of pale bluee or deep blue in your container for this to work.

To sac a corpse type x and press enter. You will use any skills you have like corpsecutter and/or bloodsacrifice.

Some of these will work  even if you don't have the skill, this will change as work progresses.
autostore put certain items in your container. For now just soulstones.
noautostore turn autostorage off.
You will not autostore yellow and red soulstones.

Botting:
Because it is hard to make a generic bot for leveling any character that is left to the user. You can create classes and read them in as needed and still use variables and triggers defined in the main file. if you create a bot load it like this:
#class bot read bot.tin
and when you are finished close it with:
#class bot kill
Some bots that are not combat based will be added as they are written.
Woadbot
If you have deanimate and wood woad spells you can create woads automatically and deanimate them for future use. To do this, go to the boat shop in Zin, n from wp, e to the bridge, s, s, e, s, s, s, w, n and then type:
buildwoads number
where number is the amount of woads you want to create for example:
buildwoads 20
will make 20 wood woads, deanimate them, and store them in your container. Each woad currently costs 12 gold. It is best to do this while afk, because there is a 30 second regen time between each woad. You will get a message when the process starts and completes. If you are using tensor's floating disk and it gets full the bot will automatically cast a new one for you. You can not create an infinite number of woads though because the disks only last a short time.
