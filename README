NOTES:
Players who can see, who are not using the blind mode on the game:
For better readability, open aa.tin and delete the line:
#GAG              {^$}

Quest code works great now. The code now uses the newly added kxwt_event quest feature. In short, this means quests are posted right away, no odd hacks needed.
Sound now uses sox. Although you can still set a new player in sound variables it will most likely break the trigger pack. Sox is available for pretty much every distro though so there shouldn't be any problems.
To counter the bug in gnome-terminal with the Orca screen reader, a space has been added to the beginning of each line.
If you don't need this and want to get rid of it, open aa.tin and delete the line:
#SUBSTITUTE       {%*}  { %0}  {1}
Work has started on background music/sound effects. If you happen to notice a lot of blank lines and the screen is hard to read type:
set ctrigger off
There are no sound effects for backgrounds yet. If you want to make some read help wxkt_terrain in the game. the terrain files should be terrain-number.ogg where number is the number corrisponding to the terrain type. For example, terain-2.ogg would be for towns. Until work is finished on terrain sounds music will be off by default.

Mac Installation:
Download and extract the Mac binary of tintin++ from
http://tintin.sourceforge.net/download.php
Install macports:
http://www.macports.org/install.php
Install xcode available free   from the Mac app store
Open terminal:
To install tintin++ system wide you can move it to /opt/local/bin/ If
you have extracted the files in the Downloads directory, the command
would be:
sudo mv ~/Downloads/tt++ /opt/local/bin/tt++
sudo port install git-core sox wget xz coreutils
After everything has installed successfully link the commmand gshuf to the command shuf by typing:
sudo ln /opt/local/bin/gshuf /opt/local/bin/shuf
To be able to use the alt key abilities provided in this trigger pack, open terminal preferences and on the keyboard tab check use option as meta. Finally, select the file menu and choose use as defaults.

Connecting:
To connect, edit name.tin. Change the text in the second set of braces in each of the 2 variables to match your character's name and password.
To start tintin++ with the sound and trigger pack loaded type:
tt++ aa.tin
To login your existing character type either aa or login and press enter.
If this is your first time logging in, or if you have updated skills and spells using another client, type the word load and press enter after your character is logged in. This is important for some of the automatic features.

Requirements:
tintin++, sox, shuf, and wget
Optional:
cmus, fbcmd, and TTYtter

Skills and Spells:
Some skills and spells can automatically be used while you are playing. To make sure everything is set up, type load. You should only need to do this once, because the data will now be saved in the file game_data.tin. To make sure the data is up to date, when you practice a new skill or spell, type skill or spell followed by the name of the skill or spell you just practiced. for example, if you have just practiced kick for the first time, type:
skill kick
to make sure it is added to the variables in game_data.tin.
An example of autousage is clay man for necromancers. To turn on automatic recast when your clay man dies type autoclay and to turn it back off type noautoclay.

Twitter:
You can have achievements like backstabs, levels, and achievements posted to Twitter. If you have the CLI Twitter client TTYtter installed and configured correctly, type twitter and events will be posted. To turn it off type notwitter.

Commands:
In most cases, for longer words, you can type part of the command. The exception to this is auto stuff like autoclay, autobone, autofiend, autostore, etc - You will have to experiment because the  commands start where mud commands end. For example, if you type fire, you will connect to the fire channel. If, however, you type fireb all the way through fireball, you will cast the spell fireball if you have it.

The container variable needs to be set for this to work as well. Anytime you put something somewhere the destination is set as your container. So, put gondola sack will set your container as sack)

Equipment Sets:
There are built in change commands to wear equipment sets quickly. To use the speed switching you must name your eqset like so:
cclev = cleric cast level
mclev = mage cast level
nclev = necromancer cast level
tsklev = thief skill level
wsklev = warrior skill level
to change into a set simply type the first letter of the set you want followed by the word set. For example, to change into mage cast level you would type mset or for warrior skill level wset.
To create an equipment set in the game, while wearing the equipment you want to include in the set, type eqset create name container. for example, to store mclev in your bag you would type:
eqset create mclev bag

Music:
If you like to listen to music using cmus while playing, you can now control it right from within tintin++. Here are the controls:
alt+z: previous track
alt+x: play
alt+c pause
alt+v stop (if you are in gnome-terminal use alt+shift+V)
alt+b: next track
alt+shift+R toggle repeat
alt+shift+S: toggle shuffle
alt+shift+_: volume down
alt+shift++: volume up
alt+shift+M: Post currently playing file to music channel

Botting:
Because it is hard to make a generic bot for leveling any character that is left to the user. You can create classes and read them in as needed and still use variables and triggers defined in the main file. if you create a bot load it like this:
#class bot read bot.tin
and when you are finished close it with:
#class bot kill
Some bots that are not combat based will be added as they are written.
Woadbot
If you have deanimate and wood woad spells you can create woads automatically and deanimate them for future use. To do this, go to the boat shop in Zin, n from wp, e to the bridge, s, s, e, s, s, s, w, n and then type:
buildwoads number
where number is the amount of woads you want to create for example:
buildwoads 20
will make 20 wood woads, deanimate them, and store them in your container. Each woad currently costs 12 gold. It is best to do this while afk, because there is a 30 second regen time between each woad. You will get a message when the process starts and completes. If you are using tensor's floating disk and it gets full the bot will automatically cast a new one for you. You can not create an infinite number of woads though because the disks only last a short time.
