Here are some tips to help you better use tintin++
If you have tips you want added mudmail Goroth with the info, or send me a tell on the game.

To do an action more than once you can put # followed by the amount of times you want to repeat the command. If you have multiple commands put them inside braces. A great use for this is preparing corpses with soulstones:
#4 {get pale soulstone $container;prepare corpse pale}

Sometimes though you may need to perform the action on specific targets. If, for example, you want to haste all 6 of your skeletal army, you would need to use the #loop command:
#loop 1 6 i c haste .$i.skelet
It is important to not put the word skeleton because that will only do warriors. Mages are skeletal mages, so skeleton does not work as a keyword for them.
gnome-terminal users, if you would like to be able to juse keys like alt+f alt+e, etc for macros you need to open the edit menu, keyboard shortcuts, and uncheck the menu keys shortcuts box.

Useful bindings:
#Alt+t current time and optional temperature
sett #system {talking-clock -c &> /dev/null&}
#make wood woads quickly with the woad alias
setw woad
