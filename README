NOTES:
Licensed under the LGPL
Players who can see, who are not using the blind mode on the game:
For better readability, open aa.tin and delete the line:
#GAG              {^$}
To counter a bug in gnome-terminal with the Orca screen reader, a space has been added to the beginning of each line.
If you don't need this and want to get rid of it, open aa.tin and delete the line:
#SUBSTITUTE       {%*}  { %0}  {1}

Multiple Characters:
If you have multiple characters, the best way to support all of them is to keep the git directory clane, and create directories for each character, then link to the relevant files. Here is an example assuming tintin-alteraeon is in your home directory.
make the character directory
mkdir ~/rigby
cd ~/rigby
cp ../tintin-alteraeon/*.tin .
ln -s ../tintin-alteraeon/sounds/ .
Finally, because aa.tin is the most often updated file, we will make a link to it. First remove the existing file:
rm aa.tin
then, link the file from the main tintin-alteraeon directory:
ln ../tintin-alteraeon/aa.tin .
Repeat this for all your characters. Then, you only need pull updates in the main tintin-alteraeon/ directory

Installation:
Mac:
Download and extract the Mac binary of tintin++ from
http://tintin.sourceforge.net/download.php
Install macports:
http://www.macports.org/install.php
Install xcode and its command line tools available free   from the Mac app store. The command line tools can be found under the download button on the toolbar, it's the last item in the components table.
Open terminal:
To install tintin++ system wide you can move it to /opt/local/bin/ If
you have extracted the files in the Downloads directory, the command
would be:
sudo mv ~/Downloads/tt++ /opt/local/bin/tt++
sudo port install git-core sox wget xz coreutils
After everything has installed successfully link the commmand gshuf to the command shuf by typing:
sudo ln /opt/local/bin/gshuf /opt/local/bin/shuf
To be able to use the alt key abilities provided in this trigger pack, open terminal preferences and on the keyboard tab check use option as meta. Finally, select the file menu and choose use as defaults.

Linux:
Requirements:
tintin++, sox, shuf, and wget
All of the above should be available from your package manager, and all except possibly tintin++ and sox should already be installed

Optional:
cmus, fbcmd, and TTYtter

Updating:
To get updates, while in the tintin-alteraeon/ directory, type:
git pull

Connecting:
cd tintin-alteraeon/ (or your character name directory)
You must be in the tintin-alteraeon directory for everything to work properly.
before launching tintin++ for the first time, edit name.tin. Change the text in the second set of braces in each of the 2 variables to match your character's name and password.
To start tintin++ with the sound and trigger pack loaded type:
tt++ aa.tin
To login your existing character type either aa or login and press enter.
If this is your first time logging in, or if you have updated skills and spells using another client, type the word load and press enter after your character is logged in. This is important for some of the automatic features.


Skills and Spells:
Some skills and spells can automatically be used while you are playing. To make sure everything is set up, type load. You should only need to do this once, because the data will now be saved in the file game_data.tin.
If you want to add your own triggers, aliases, macros, etc, add them to the file game_data.tin. This file will rarely change, and even if it does, you can backup your game_data and restore from it after pulling from git.
If you want to turn off the automatic use of a skill or spell, you can either delete its variable from game_data.tin, or from within the game type #unvar variableName. For example, if you do not want to automatically use cry of victory:
#unvariable cryOfVictory
If the skill or spell name hasw spaces in it, leave the spaces out when searching for the variable but caps each word after the first, eexample:
crystalSpear

Social Networking:
Twitter:
You can have character information like backstabs, levels, and achievements posted to Twitter. If you have the CLI Twitter client TTYtter installed and configured correctly, type twitter and events will be posted. To turn it off type notwitter.

Facebook:
You can have character information like backstabs, levels, and achievements posted to Facebook. If you have the CLI Facebook client fbcmd installed and configured correctly, type facebook and events will be posted to your wall. To turn it off type nofacebook
http://fbcmd.dtompkins.com/installation

Commands:
In most cases, for longer words, you can type part of the command. The exception to this is auto stuff like autoclay, autobone, autofiend, autostore, etc - You will have to experiment because the  commands start where mud commands end. For example, if you type fire, you will connect to the fire channel. If, however, you type fireb all the way through fireball, you will cast the spell fireball if you have it.
When you put items in something the something becomes your container. So, you can set your container even if you don't have the itme:
put bunny sack
even if you don't have a bunny, sack will become your container.
Woad and bone material variables are already set to the most common item used to make them. If, however, you wish to change them, or if you want to set metal construct you should do it like a standard tintin++ variable:
#variable {woadMaterial} {tree}
#var boneMaterial skeleton
#variable {metalMaterial} {dumpster}

Equipment Sets:
There are built in change commands to wear equipment sets quickly. To use the speed switching you must name your eqset like so:
cclev = cleric cast level
mclev = mage cast level
nclev = necromancer cast level
tsklev = thief skill level
wsklev = warrior skill level
to change into a set simply type the first letter of the set you want followed by the word set. For example, to change into mage cast level you would type mset or for warrior skill level wset.
To create an equipment set in the game, while wearing the equipment you want to include in the set, type eqset create name container. for example, to store mclev in your bag you would type:
eqset create mclev bag

Botting:
Because it is hard to make a generic bot for leveling any character that is left to the user. You can create classes and read them in as needed and still use variables and triggers defined in the main file. if you create a bot load it like this:
#class bot read bot.tin
and when you are finished close it with:
#class bot kill
Some bots that are not combat based will be added as they are written.
Woadbot
If you have deanimate and wood woad spells you can create woads automatically and deanimate them for future use. To do this, go to the boat shop in Zin, n from wp, e to the bridge, s, s, e, s, s, s, w, n and then type:
buildwoads number
where number is the amount of woads you want to create for example:
buildwoads 20
will make 20 wood woads, deanimate them, and store them in your container. Each woad currently costs 12 gold. It is best to do this while afk, because there is a 30 second regen time between each woad. You will get a message when the process starts and completes. If you are using tensor's floating disk and it gets full the bot will automatically cast a new one for you. You can not create an infinite number of woads though because the disks only last a short time.
