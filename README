NOTES:
A first attempt at tweeting quest completion has been added. It is likely to be buggy, so please let me know. This is a particularly difficult bit of code to write because there is no uniform quest completion message. So, if you have completed a quest and you have twitter enabled, don't fret if the quest isn't posted right away. There are several actions that trigger it, getting/taking stuff, talking to mobs, killing mobs all cause a check to see if your last completed quest has changed, if so it wil tweet the quest.
Finally switched over to ogg12 for sounds, so now the requirement of vorbis-tools is more necessary. If for some reason you can not use vorbis toos though just change the soundCommand variable in aa.tin.
To counter the bug in gone-terminal with the Orca screen reader a spacem has been added to the beginning of each line.
If you don't need this and want to get rid of it, delete the one substitute in the aa.tin file. Do a search for the line starting with #SUBSTITUTE
Work has started on background music/sound effects. If you happen to notice a lot of blank lines and the screen is hard to read type:
set ctrigger off
There are no sound effects for backgrounds yet. If you want to make some read help wxkt_terrain in the game. the terrain files should be terrain-number.ogg where number is the number corrisponding to the terrain type. For example, terain-2.ogg would be for towns. Until work is finished on terrain sounds music will be off by default.

Connecting:
To connect edit aa.tin and find the name and password variables at the bottom of the file. Change the text in the second set of braces in each variable to match your character's details. Load the file with tt++ aa.tin.
#variable {password} {password}

Requirements:
ogg123 part of vorbis-tools
shuf usually included in most distros

Skills and Spells:
Some skills and spells can automatically be used while you are playing. OTo make sure everything is set up type load. You may also want to type load when you first practice a new skill or spell. An example of autousage is clay man for necromancers. To turn on automatica recast when your clay man dies type autoclay and to turn it back off type noautoclay.

Twitter:
You can have achievements like backstabs, levels, and achievements posted to Twitter. If you have the CLI Twitter client TTYtter installed and configured correctly type twitter and events will be posted. To turn it off type notwitter.

Commands:
In most cases for longer words you can type part of the command. You will have to expirement because the  commands start where mud commends end. For example, if you type fire you will connect to the fire channel. If, however, you type fireb all the way through fireball you will cast the spell fireball if you have it.
